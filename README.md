# Starknet Bridge Aggregator

 1. Project Overview
- Project Name: AggreNet 
- Description: A bridge aggregator built on Starknet to enable seamless cross-chain token transfers by integrating multiple bridges into a unified interface.
-Key Features:
  - Aggregation of multiple bridges for efficient token transfers.
  - Intelligent routing to minimize fees and optimize speed.
  - User-friendly interface with support for multiple wallets.
  - Support for native Starknet assets and popular tokens.


2. Problem Statement
- Lack of interoperability and fragmented liquidity across bridges creates challenges for users.
- High fees and slow transaction speeds in some bridges lead to suboptimal user experience.
- Starknet, as a ZK-rollup, requires efficient cross-chain solutions for greater ecosystem utility.


 3. Solution
- A unified platform on Starknet that aggregates multiple bridges, allowing users to compare routes and select the most efficient one for their needs.
- Features like:
  - Smart Bridge Routing: Automatically selects the best bridge based on fees, speed, and liquidity.
  - Transaction Monitoring: Real-time updates on the status of cross-chain transfers.
  - DeFi Integration: Direct integration with wallets and dApps for smooth user onboarding.

4. Architecture
System Design:
- Frontend: React.js/Next.js for a seamless user interface.
- Backend: Node.js with APIs for bridge data aggregation.
- Smart Contracts: Starknet Cairo smart contracts for managing token flows.
- Bridges Integrated: List the bridges (e.g., starkgate,orbitor finance, mini bridge,rhino fi ..).
- Routing Algorithm: Custom algorithm to optimize bridge selection based on key parameters.


Day 1: Development Kickoff
Objective: Establish the foundation for the project.
- Planning:
  - Finalize the project scope, key features, and architecture.
  - Identify which bridges to integrate(e.g., starkgate,orbitor finance, mini bridge,rhino fi ..).

  - Define smart contract requirements and the routing algorithm.
- Development:
  - Set up the development environment for Starknet (Cairo compiler, Starknet.js).
  - Initialize the GitHub repository and create a project structure for frontend, backend, and contracts.
  - Deploy a basic Cairo smart contract for token transfers on Starknet testnet.
  - Build a simple UI wireframe using React.js/Next.js.
- *Deliverables:*
  - Project architecture diagram.
  - Initial smart contract deployed on testnet (basic token transfer functionality).
  - GitHub repository with code structure.

Day 2: Core Functionality Development
Objective: Implement bridge integration and routing logic.
- Development:
  - Integrate APIs/SDKs of the selected bridges into the backend.
  - Develop the backend service to fetch real-time data (fees, liquidity, transfer times) from integrated bridges.
  - Implement the routing algorithm to select the best bridge based on user inputs.
  - Extend Cairo smart contracts to include logic for interacting with integrated bridges.
- *Frontend:
  - Develop the UI for bridge selection, token input, and route comparison.
  - Integrate wallet support (e.g., ArgentX, Braavos) for signing transactions.
- Deliverables:
  - Functional backend with real-time bridge data aggregation.
  - Updated UI with token selection, bridge options, and wallet integration.
- adding two modes for use so we integreate one mode named dazon mode and advance mode

Day 3: Testing & Feature Expansion
Objective: Ensure stability and expand functionality.
- Development:
  - Add one bridges for aggregation and validate their integration.
  - Implement transaction monitoring on the frontend to display real-time updates.
  - Introduce error handling and fallback mechanisms for failed bridge transactions.
  - Optimize the Cairo smart contract for gas efficiency.
- Testing:
  - Perform end-to-end testing of token transfers across bridges.
  - Debug frontend and backend for any edge cases (e.g., low liquidity, network delays).
  - Conduct security checks on smart contracts.
- Deliverables:
  - Fully tested bridge aggregator with at least two functional bridges.
-Routing algorithm implemented in the backend.
  - Debugged smart contracts and backend services.
  - Frontend with real-time transaction monitoring and error handling.
- adding two modes for use so we integreate one mode named advance mode







Day 4: Finalization and Demo Preparation
Objective: Polish the project and prepare the demo.
- Development:
  - Refine the UI/UX for a seamless user experience.
  - Add analytics (e.g., estimated fees, transfer times, and bridge usage stats).
  - Conduct final contract audits and deploy on the Starknet testnet.
- Documentation:
  - Write comprehensive documentation for the smart contracts, APIs, and frontend.
  - Prepare a README file for the GitHub repository.
  - Create a presentation highlighting key features, architecture, and demo flow.
- Demo Preparation:
  - Record a walkthrough video of the project.
  - Host the frontend application (e.g., on Vercel) for live demo access.
- Deliverables:
  - Polished and fully functional bridge aggregator.
  - Deployed app link and GitHub repository.
  - Presentation slides and/or walkthrough video.
